  %h4 A few notes about this site:
  %p
    If you made a mistake and your score won't compile you can still use ctrl-z to undo changes.
    This is possible because the input-textarea is not reloaded after you submit a score, so any
    changes are still remembered by your browser. 
  %p
    As indicated by "\version" statement you'll see when you create a new document, Lilydocs
    is currently using lilypond 2.12.3.
