Very basic ruby on rails app that hosts Lilypond as webapp.

This app has not been run (as far a I know), and I have not maintained  since 2012.

!!!!!!! Github reports a severe vulnarability in the version of the "devise" gem this app uses. !!!!!!

lilydocs is configured to always use https in the 'production' evironment.

There are settings to be configured if you want to run this app.

They are in config/environment.rb.template and config/environment/production.rb.template. look for the "raise" statements.
